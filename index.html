    <h1>Purpose</h1>
    <p>This personal website was a project that I created while I was a Senior in college. We had to use HTML, CSS, and JS to construct our own personal website.</p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Within this website, I have created different tabs to store different information about myself. I have created this website purely based on coding elements</p>

    <h1>About myself</h1>
    <p>My name is Christian Tackett, and I am a senior currently studying Management Information Systems at the University of Oklahoma. 
        I will graduate in May of 2021 with a Major in MIS, and a Minor in Marketing. I was born in Denver, Colorado and later moved to Maryland. I finished highschool
        in Plano, Texas at Plano West Senior Highschool, where I was involved in a numerous amounts of clubs and organizations. I played Basketball and Football in junior high, where 
        I developed strong leadership skills. Given the opportunity to play as the Quarterback in football, I was given a lot of responsibilities. This changed the way
        that I am today, because I always am the leader in projects that I am assigned within a group.
